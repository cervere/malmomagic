Conditioning 101

To start with, Agent starts walking and everytime it finds that it is on a cobblestone, it takes a detour to collect a reward and falls back to the previous course.

Agent knows to jump if there is lava in front, of course with expense of some energy.

NOTE:
This is trivial for now. But the idea is to maintain such resources like energy, hunger etc and also associate the block like cobblestone as a CS and to the reward as some US.
