Getting started with Malmo


Okay.. here is the plan!

Assuming you have already installed Malmo, every python program you want to run needs this module 'MalmoPlatform.so' to be able to open Malmo.

So this file is available in the current folder. Run the following for the programs to be able to access it.
 
'''
cervere@cervere:~/Documents/dirtest$ python setup.py ; source ~/.bashrc 
Adding current dir /home/cervere/Documents/dirtest to PYTHONPATH in your bashrc so that MalmoPlatform.so is accesible to your malmo programs
Done!
'''

For every tiny program/situation/scenario our heroine is in, lets have a folder 

`./<< some sensible experiment name >>`

with a README file which would describe what that whole experiment is all about (in a human readable format)

`./<< the same sensible experiment name used above >>/README.md`

For now
